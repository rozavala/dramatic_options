"""ContextPack — the grounded evidence a council agent reasons over (T2 + the §9 corpus).

A candidate is a ``themes.Theme`` from the operator's watchlist (themes.json) or a T3 sentinel.
For each, we assemble **current** evidence — recent news headlines via ``data/news.py:NewsData``
(hand-seeds) or deterministic markers (sentinels) — plus the §9 evidence-grounding corpus
(``data/fundamentals.py``: filed XBRL numbers) and the §19 sell-side **analyst-coverage** count
(``data/analyst_coverage.py``). The pack carries the operator's seed thesis as the *hypothesis to
test*, kept separate from the *evidence* used for grounding.

**§9 (PREREG_EVIDENCE_GROUNDING) — evidence, never permission:**
- ``fundamentals`` (the pinned corpus lines) + the ``analyst_count`` coverage proxy enrich every
  pack; they NEVER loosen a floor/criterion/gate/cap.
- The ONE behavior change is origin-scoped: a thin-news **hand-seed** with fundamentals-present is
  now ``grounded`` (the OR-leg — it deliberates instead of $0-dropping). A **sentinel**'s
  ``grounded`` is byte-unchanged (markers ⇔ grounded).

**§19 (accel-feed record, 2026-06-30) — analyst-coverage replaces news-count as the coverage
proxy:** the ``under_narrated`` attention input is now the sell-side analyst count (a materially
better meter than the sparse free news feed — Jaccard ~0.46 vs news-quiet), rendered as the
``ANALYST_COVERAGE`` line. News HEADLINES still ground the pack (``coverage_count``/``has_numeric``
→ ``grounded``); only the trailing news *counts* are retired as the attention signal. Attention,
not inflection — a low count is a quietness proxy, never proof of an inflection (record §19 caveat).

**Framer byte-identity (§6 leash):** the T3 framer builds its pack via ``sentinel_context_pack``
with no corpus (``fundamentals=None``, ``analyst_count=None``), so ``as_prompt_block`` renders
exactly as it did pre-§9 (the ``NEWS_COVERAGE: N article(s)`` fallback). The FUNDAMENTALS /
ANALYST_COVERAGE lines are purely conditional (rendered only when present), so the framer's prompt
is unchanged. (§2 pins FUNDAMENTALS after the headlines block and the coverage line stays in place —
order pinned in the tests; the anti-HARK purpose [a fixed, stamped order] is preserved.)
