"""Council proposal types + the proposal→Theme adapter (T2).

A ``CouncilProposal`` is the strategist's synthesized verdict for one candidate, carrying the
per-agent contributions for forward scoring. ``to_theme()`` is the hard-seam boundary: it
projects a proposal down to a ``themes.Theme`` that the *unchanged* deterministic paper loop
consumes. Conviction rides along on the Theme for **recording only** — the loop never reads it
for sizing (PREREG §5: flat-by-slots) and it can never defeat a deterministic veto.
